input and parameter txt has double and integer value in it, these values are changable to any amount

but the item number has to be exact inorder for the program to allocate that much memory to store the item weight.

Each variable is named and its value its placed after (tab)|(tab) which is used to parse the variable to the program.

the weights of the item is place after ---------------item wight--------------- line

any items over previously given item number limit or blank space is considered as 0.0 weight.

note that input and parameter txt file has to be present for the program to run.
